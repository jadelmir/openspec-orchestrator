# Orch Archive

Archive completed work through OpenSpec.

## Source of Truth

OpenSpec is the ONLY source of truth.

## MUST

- Verify the OpenSpec work is complete.
- Use RTK for supported verification commands.
- MUST NOT archive incomplete or failed work.
- MUST NOT create an Orch archive.
- Archive through OpenSpec only.
- Report token savings when available.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant OpenSpec change.
2. Confirm required tasks are complete.
3. Run relevant verification.
4. If verification fails, stop and report the issue, but STILL present mandatory Orch Run Summary.
5. If complete, use the installed OpenSpec archive workflow.
6. Return the archive result and mandatory Orch Run Summary.

## Mandatory Orch Run Summary

At workflow completion (even if archive is refused or fails):
MUST display actual Orch optimization state.

MUST NOT assume a tool was used merely because it is installed.

MUST NOT fabricate token savings. Use "not measured" when values cannot be measured.

Desired final report format:
