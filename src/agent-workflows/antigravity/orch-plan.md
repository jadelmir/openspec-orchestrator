# Orch Plan

Plan the requested change through OpenSpec.

## Source of Truth

OpenSpec is the ONLY source of truth.

## MUST

- MUST NOT create an Orch-specific competing plan.
- MUST use OpenSpec for persistent planning.
- Determine the minimum required context.
- Prefer targeted reads.
- Use Repomix only if broad context is required.
- Use LLMLingua only if context remains large.
- Use RTK for supported verbose terminal commands.
- Report token savings when available.
- DO NOT implement the planned work.

## Workflow

1. Read relevant OpenSpec state.
2. Understand the requested change.
3. Explore minimum necessary code context.
4. Use the installed OpenSpec planning/proposal workflow.
5. Ensure the resulting plan lives only in OpenSpec.
6. Return a planning summary and mandatory Orch Run Summary.

## Mandatory Orch Run Summary

At workflow completion:
MUST display actual Orch optimization state.

MUST NOT assume a tool was used merely because it is installed.

MUST NOT fabricate token savings. Use "not measured" when values cannot be measured.

Desired final report format:
